Question 1 : Increasing Training Set Size Experiment: Consider the iris dataset for multiclass
classification and perform the following steps.
1. Divide the data into 80% training and 20% testing.
2. From the training set only take 5% of the data and train the supervised learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random
Forest, and Naive Bayes) and test it on the test set created in the previous step.
3. Repeat the training again with now 10% of the data and keep on adding the 5% until you use the whole training set.
4. In every training test on the 20% of the test set and report the accuracy and f1-score of the model.
5. Plot the sample graph for accuracy and f1-score as provided below:
